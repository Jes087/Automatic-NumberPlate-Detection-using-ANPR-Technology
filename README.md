# Automatic-NumberPlate-Detection-using-ANPR-Technology

 The project on vehicle authentication integrates image detection, recognition, and Python
 programming to establish a robust security-based authentication system. Leveraging ma
chine learning techniques, the model is trained on a dataset comprising images containing
 vehicle number plates to enhance accuracy in plate recognition. Upon vehicle entry, the
 system extracts the number plate and performs a matching process against authorized
 plates, promptly alerting authorities in case of unauthorized access. This innovative solu
tion holds significant potential across various security applications, providing a proactive
 means for authorities to take appropriate actions based on real-time alerts.
 By combining image processing techniques with EasyOCR, the system efficiently
 f
 ilters images and trains the OCR model to accurately recognize text. In practical imple
mentation, when a vehicle enters a restricted area, the system swiftly checks the number
 plate against an authorized database. In the event of a mismatch, automated notifications
 are promptly dispatched to the relevant authorities, enabling swift response to unautho
rized access attempts. This project represents a sophisticated yet user-friendly approach
 to enhancing security measures, ensuring stringent enforcement of access control proto
cols to safeguard restricted areas effectively.
